This a simple project that demonstartes how to use retrofit in the android application.
The code is based on an excellent video tutorial by Prabeesh, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYWRv7Fasgg
Basically In order to use retrofit we need three things
1. Retrofit instance
2. Model class for serialization and deserialization
3. Interface for possible API calls.
